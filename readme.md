## About

A fully-functional SkyWars map custom dimensions in vanilla Minecraft.
Supports up to 12 people.

SkyWars is a 12-player PvP game where players spawn on separate islands, gather loot, and fight other players in a bid to be the last one standing. There is a larger island in the center of the map which contains better loot than you would find on your spawn island.
