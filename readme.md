## About:

Made for Minecraft 1.17+

A fully-functional SkyWars datapack using custom dimensions in vanilla Minecraft.

SkyWars is a PvP game where players spawn on separate islands, gather loot, and fight other players in a bid to be the last one standing. There is a larger island in the center of the map which contains better loot than you would find on your spawn island.

Featuring multiple maps (may lag a bit when changing maps).

## Features:

- Custom Dimension (will not affect your overworld, nether or end dimensions)
- Auto resetting maps
- Multiple Maps
- Random Loot
- Random Spawns
- Up to 16 players (based on map size)

## Usage:

View the main menu:
```
/trigger sw.menu
```

Go to the SkyWars lobby: *(inventory must be empty, must be in overworld)*
```
/trigger sw.lobby
```

Leave SkyWars: *(will tp you back to where you were before joining the lobby)*
```
/trigger sw.leave
```
